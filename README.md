### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to align elements properly without the aid of media query thereby setting the display: flex, width, height, flex-direction, justify-contents, align-items.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  width: 288px;
  height: 450px;
}
```

### Continued development

I'd personally like to concentrate on mobile reponsiveness thereby ensuring there are proper alignment in the sections of the website and also nice styling too
